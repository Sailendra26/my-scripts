Why Scripting?

Automation goals: Speed and Accuracy

1. Speed
2. Accuracy, no human errors
3. Consistency
4. Scalability, can work for infinite number of servers
5. Documentaion. What happened including history
6. Reusability.

What is Git? (simple)

Git is a tool that helps you save versions of your code and track changes so you can go back anytime.

Why Git is used:

1)To track who changed what
2)To go back to older versions
3)To work with a team safely
4)To avoid losing code

Basic Git + GitHub Workflow:
-----------------------------

git clone vs git pull
=====================
clone -> use when downloading the code for the first time
pull -> just to pull the latest changes

STEPS:
-------

*)git clone https://github.com/yourname/my-scripts.git
*)git status
*)git add hello.sh (or git add . to add all files)
*)git commit -m "Add hello script"
*)git push origin main


1)Create a repository in GitHub

Example: create repo named "my-scripts".This is the remote repository.

2)Clone the repository to your system

*)git clone https://github.com/yourname/my-scripts.git

*)A folder "my-scripts" is created on your system. This is your local repository.

3)Go inside the project folder and create a file

*)cd my-scripts
*)Create file: hello.sh
*)echo "Hello DevOps"

4)Check file status

*)git status

Shows hello.sh as untracked.

5)Add file to staging area

*)git add hello.sh (or git add . to add all files)

6)Commit to local repository

*)git commit -m "Add hello script"

Changes are now saved in the local repo.

7)Push to GitHub (remote repository)

*)git push origin main

Changes are now sent to GitHub.

#!/bin/bash -> Shebang

it should be the first line in shell script, it is the interpret to check the syntax of the script and execute them
