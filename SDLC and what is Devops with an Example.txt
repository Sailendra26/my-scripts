Waterfall:

School Management System :
---------------------------

Stakeholders --> Who is part of the system
Teachers --> Students --> Parents --> Staff (Principal) --> Investors and Management Government
Grand Final
100 years ago 

28 Students -> they don't read from DAY-1
Teachers -> they don't teach from DAY-1
Parents -> They worry from DAY-1

20-30% -pass percentage
why 70% failed

Problems:
----------
1. only exam time
2. teachers wont ark to study seriously

Changes that school management done to improve the pass percentage:
--------------------------------------------------------------------

UNIT Tests I, II, III, IV
Quarterly, Half yearly, Pre-Final

20-30% - fail percentage

80% - pass percentage

still to make it 100 % pass percentage the management have done Changes few more changes in exams:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Slip/Daily tests

365 days
200 days
150 slip tests

95% - pass percentage 

Gurukul school - Waterfall
Unit Tests - Agile
Daily slip tests - Devops

Waterfall:
-----------

Assume that your company got a project from a X-client and the project deadline is 2 years. so developers will not take it that seriously
thinking that they have lot of time and testers they cannot do anything until development part is done. Before one year to the deadline 
they may start the development and after six months they give code to the testers for testing, Testers found some defects in coding 
and told the developers and the deadline is arrived and they deployed the project with few defects and the business is not 
satisfied with the final Product as it was not implemented as per Business Expectations.

also if there are any changes business wnats make in the current plan they cannot do any changes once the plan was submitted to the company.

**IMP**
--------

*)Old traditional model of software development

*)Work happens step by step (sequentially)

Requirement → Design → Development → Testing → Operations

*)Each team works in silos (separately)

   Developers write code and hand it over to testers only after everything is done
   Testers test after full build is ready
   After testing is complete, it goes to Operations for deployment

Problems:
---------

*)If issues are found late in testing, it becomes costly and slow to fix

*)No collaboration between Dev, Test, and Ops, Teams (dev, test, ops) work in silos (separately)

*)Delivery is very slow

*)Next phase starts only after the previous one finishes



Agile:
-------

after all the poor process in waterfall , they brought in new method which is Agile-Method.
it's Sprint basis now then here you no need to develop everything in at a time, you need to develop what is required first and
you will develop the second feature and it goes on step by step. in this process the work started from day one and everything will be 
monitored by the business and can address the issues quickly and we can develop the good product in the release time.

and also if any changes business wants make in a project they can do because we are developing one feature after one.

Example:

Sign up Login
Product Management 
Order Management
Payment
Shipping delivery
Reviews

Sprint -1 :
-------------

1)Sign up Login

If there is anything pending in Sprint-1 and it will be moved to Backlog 

Sprint -2:
-------------

You will have to complete the sprint-1 pending work as well as current feature 

2)Product Management 


still there are few issues in Agile to adopt this technolgy

**IMP**
---------

*)Introduced to make development faster and adaptive

*)Work happens in small iterations (sprints)

    Developers and testers work closely from the beginning
    Testing is done parallelly in each sprint

*)Continuous feedback from customers and stakeholders

But still a major gap existed:
------------------------------

*)Ops team was separate, they only got the product after testing was done.
*)Caused delays in deployment and production issues.

Devops:
--------

DevOps is a culture and is a process that removes the gap between development, testing, and operations teams. 
Instead of working separately like in older models, all three teams work together from the beginning. 
DevOps focuses on collaboration and automation using CI/CD pipelines to build, test, and deploy code quickly. 
Testers perform continuous testing from the start and the operations team gets involved early to set up infrastructure and monitoring. 
This approach enables faster deployments, early bug detection, continuous delivery of features, better product quality, 
and strong teamwork between Dev, Test, and Ops.

Earlier in Waterfall, developers wrote code for months, testers waited till the end, and ops deployed manually — so everything was delayed. 
Agile solved the dev and tester delay by delivering in small sprints, but ops delay was still there because deployment was manual. 
DevOps fixed that by automating build, test, and deployment, and by making dev, test, and ops work together — so software can go live the same day.


 Developers (Dev)
   - Write code and commit changes
        ↓
⚙️ CI/CD Pipeline
   - Automatically build, test, and package code
        ↓
📦 Deploy to Staging
   - Staging is a copy of production used for final testing
        ↓
🔍 Continuous Testing + Feedback (Testers)
   - Testers test and give quick feedback to Dev to fix bugs
        ↓
🧑‍💼 Operations (Ops)
   - Deploy to production, monitor app, and give feedback
        ↓
🔁 Feedback Loop
   - Continuous improvement by Dev, Test, and Ops together


Devops is a process of developing, building, deploying and testing on the same day that can actually improve co-ordination between all the teams,
So for better productivity and to reduce human errors we use multiple tools like CI/CD(jenkins), Configuration management to achieve this process.

What is DevSecOps?

*)It is an improved version of DevOps.
*)In DevOps, security was mostly checked at the end, which caused delays if issues were found late.
*)DevSecOps brings the Security team into the DevOps process from the start.
*)Security is built into every stage — from coding to deployment
*)Developers, testers, operations, and security all work together from the beginning
*)Automated security checks are added in CI/CD pipelines.
*)Fix security issues early before going to production.
